# Credit Card Lead Prediction Project

## Overview

Identifying potential credit card leads is crucial for financial institutions to expand their customer base and increase revenue. This project aims to predict customers' interest in acquiring a recommended credit card using machine learning models. The dataset used is the "Credit Card Lead Prediction" dataset from Kaggle.
